Feedback:
- 	reviews_all is great when you want to get all the available reviews but it can be problematic sometimes because you might hit the rate limit easily, and Be hard to control especially in production. Try reviews with pagination.
- 	Once you create a dashboards, add a screenshot to the readme file
